  Here is an Image. Perform the Following Steps:-
      1. Extract atleast 10 or more keywords from the image including its color, tone, mood, theme, flowiness if there is, texture etc.
      2. Use those keywords to generate a prompt to generate an image of'
GEMINI_PROMPT_TWO = 'with those exact keywords.
      3. Use the above Prompt to generate the image and return it.
      **Do NOT use the provided image directly to generate the asked result. use the keywords provided in step 1 instead.

You are given a source image. DO NOT use it to directly generate or guide the output image in *any* visual way.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look at the image and extract at least 15 detailed keywords that describe ONLY its visual *style*, not content. These include:
   - Color palette (e.g., pastel pinks, grayscale, neon blue)
   - Mood (e.g., eerie, romantic, futuristic, chaotic)
   - Texture (e.g., metallic, matte, fluffy, grainy)
   - Visual flow or movement (e.g., wavy, rigid, fluid, spiral)
   - Lighting (e.g., low light, cinematic, natural daylight)
   - Pattern details (e.g., stripes, fractals, polka dots)
   - Artistic or aesthetic feel (e.g., vaporwave, brutalist, anime-core, retro-futuristic)

2. Using ONLY these style keywords, construct a highly descriptive prompt to generate a new image of a completely different object:'

GEMINI_STYLE_TRANSFER_PROMPT_TWO = '3. IMPORTANT: The output image must look like a normal '

GEMINI_STYLE_TRANSFER_PROMPT_THREE=', but designed or styled using ONLY the extracted aesthetic. You are NOT allowed to preserve shape, pose, layout, or any direct features of the source image.

4. Do NOT use the original image as input or reference for structure. Use it ONLY as a *style sample* for keyword extraction.

5. Final Output: 
   The image created using ONLY the prompt from step 2

DO NOT:
- Copy structure or composition
- Morph source object into the target
- Use the original image for content transfer

This is a pure **style abstraction and reapplication** task, not an image-to-image generation.'
